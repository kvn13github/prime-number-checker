# prime-number-checker
First it asks for a number, then says if it is a prime number and then what kind of special prime if so, and gives a quick description and field of use.

Output example:

Enter a number greater than 0 to check for primes: 997

997 is a prime number.

997 is a Chen prime. A Chen prime is a prime number p such that p+2 is either a prime or a semiprime (the product of two primes). These primes have applications in number theory and cryptography.

Enter a number greater than 0 to check for primes: 89

89 is a prime number.

89 is a Sophie Germain prime. A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also a prime number. These primes are important in public-key cryptography, particularly in the generation of strong primes for use in RSA encryption.

89 is a Chen prime. A Chen prime is a prime number p such that p+2 is either a prime or a semiprime (the product of two primes). These primes have applications in number theory and cryptography.

I can use different libraries especially for really great numbers, and I can still add more special prime number checks.
This code has lots of growth potential.
